# Set Lists

This is an app for quickly building set lists.

## How to use

Create a config/default.js file based on the sample file and fill in your last.fm api key.

Install it and run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Technologies in use

This is a toy project to explore using [After.js](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/after.js).

I've added in TypeScript, Apollo and Style Components.

I'm currently using a fork of after.js that supports a dynamic custom render component. This is required to allow Apollo's server side rendering to work.
